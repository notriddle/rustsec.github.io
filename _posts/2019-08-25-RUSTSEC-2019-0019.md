description: "When used in conjunction with the Hashbased Message Authentication Code HMAC, the BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s implementations in blake2 crate versions prior to v0.8.1 used an incorrect block size 32bytes instead of 64bytes for BLAKE2s, and 64bytes instead of 128bytes for BLAKE2b, causing them to miscompute the MacResult. The v0.8.1 release of the blake2 crate uses the correct block sizes. Note that this advisory only impacts usage of BLAKE2 with HMAC, and does not impact Digest functionality."

### Description

When used in conjunction with the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC),
the BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s implementations in `blake2` crate versions prior to
v0.8.1 used an incorrect block size (32-bytes instead of 64-bytes for BLAKE2s,
and 64-bytes instead of 128-bytes for BLAKE2b), causing them to miscompute the
`MacResult`.

The v0.8.1 release of the `blake2` crate uses the correct block sizes.

Note that this advisory only impacts usage of BLAKE2 with HMAC, and does not
impact `Digest` functionality.
