### Description

This is a test advisory useful for verifying RustSec tooling and vulnerability
detection pipelines are working correctly. Aside from the fact that it is filed
against an example crate, it is otherwise considered by the Advisory Database
itself to be a normal security advisory.

It's filed against `rustsec-example-crate`, an otherwise completely empty crate
with no functionality or code, which has two releases:

- [v0.0.1]: *vulnerable* according to this advisory
- [v1.0.0]: *patched* by this advisory

(Technically there is a third release, v0.0.0, which is yanked, but otherwise
identical to the v0.0.1 release)

[v0.0.1]: https://crates.io/crates/rustsec-example-crate/0.0.1
[v1.0.0]: https://crates.io/crates/rustsec-example-crate/1.0.0
