title:       "RUSTSEC-2019-0010: libflate: MultiDecoder::read() drops uninitialized memory of arbitrary type on panic in client code"
description: "Affected versions of libflate have set a field of an internal structure with a generic type to an uninitialized value in MultiDecoderread and reverted it to the original value after the function completed. However, execution of MultiDecoderread could be interrupted by a panic in callersupplied Read implementation. This would cause drop to be called on uninitialized memory of a generic type implementing Read.  This is equivalent to a useafterfree vulnerability and could allow an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution.  The flaw was corrected by aborting immediately instead of unwinding the stack in case of panic within MultiDecoderread. The issue was discovered and fixed by Shnatsel."

### Description

Affected versions of libflate have set a field of an internal structure with a generic type to an uninitialized value in `MultiDecoder::read()` and reverted it to the original value after the function completed. However, execution of `MultiDecoder::read()` could be interrupted by a panic in caller-supplied `Read` implementation. This would cause `drop()` to be called on uninitialized memory of a generic type implementing `Read`. 

This is equivalent to a use-after-free vulnerability and could allow an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution.
 
The flaw was corrected by aborting immediately instead of unwinding the stack in case of panic within `MultiDecoder::read()`. The issue was discovered and fixed by Shnatsel.
