Affected versions of this crate incorrectly used raw pointer,
which introduced unsoundness in its public safe API.

[Failing to drop the Drain struct causes double-free](https://github.com/hyperium/http/issues/354),
and [it is possible to violate Rust's alias rule and cause data race with Drain's Iterator implementation](https://github.com/hyperium/http/issues/355).
