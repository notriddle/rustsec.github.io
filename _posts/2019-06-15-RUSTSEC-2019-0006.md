### Description

`ncurses` exposes functions from the ncurses library which:

- Pass buffers without length to C functions that may write an arbitrary amount of
  data, leading to a buffer overflow. (`instr`, `mvwinstr`, etc)
- Passes rust &amp;str to strings expecting C format arguments, allowing a format
  vulnerability (functions in the `printw` family).
