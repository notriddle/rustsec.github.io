### Description

Affected versions of this crate exposed several methods which took `self` by
immutable reference, despite the requesting the RenderDoc API to set a mutable
value internally.

This is technically unsound and calling these methods from multiple threads
without synchronization could lead to unexpected and unpredictable behavior.
 
The flaw was corrected in release 0.5.0.
