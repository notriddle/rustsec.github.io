These files were pulled from the zipball downloaded from https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/hosting-font-awesome-yourself

They were further modified by adding these styles to the SVG root element, to make them follow the font size and color:

    style="height:1em;fill:currentColor"
